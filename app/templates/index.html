      	<p>The fact generator is produced through WBEZ’s Curious City, an ongoing project that answers the public’s questions about Chicago, the region and its people.</p>

        <p>Often, the stories are comprehensive, providing a lot of context, history and perspective. But sometimes we find that short, juicy snippets really grab your attention.</p>

		<p>The fact generator is where we collect the best of these snippets — how many bats species live in Chicago, how much it costs to clean the Bean sculpture downtown — and put them together in a fun app you can browse anywhere.</p>

		<p>Click the Still Curious button to generate a new fact. Find one you like and you can click to read the investigation it came from, or share it with your friends.</p>
